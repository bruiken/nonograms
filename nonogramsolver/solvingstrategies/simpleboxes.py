    Implementation of the simple boxes strategy.
    The idea is that this strategy is the first one called, we fill each row
    with the constraints from left to right, leaving only one space between
    each constraint. This maximally fills the constraints to the left.
    Then we do the same, but starting from the right (also at the last
    constraint). If we then find overlap between **the same constraints**,
    those boxes must be filled with crosses.
