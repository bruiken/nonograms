    Simplespaces is a strategy that can be applied when we are sure that all of the constraint blocks are in the
    array already.
    The idea is to find the spots that must be empty, we can do this by extending the score blocks to the left and right
    in the array upto the constraint it represents. This identifies the possible positions the score block can extend
    to. After we have done this for every score block, we can find the spots that are impossible to be filled with
    crosses. Those spots can be set to empty.
